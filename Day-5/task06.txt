Write your understanding on the difefrences between for, while, and do-while loop. Create their flow charts.
For Loop:
- A `for` loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.
- It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.
- The loop executes as long as the condition evaluates to true.

While Loop:
- A `while` loop is used when the number of iterations is not known and depends on a condition.
- The condition is checked before the loop body executes.
- If the condition is false initially, the loop body will not execute at all.

Do-While Loop:
- A `do-while` loop is similar to a `while` loop but ensures that the loop body executes at least once.
- The condition is checked after the loop body executes.

Flow Charts:
1. For Loop:
    [Start] -> [Initialization] -> [Condition?] -> (Yes) -> [Execute Body] -> [Increment/Decrement] -> [Condition?] -> (No) -> [End]

2. While Loop:
    [Start] -> [Condition?] -> (Yes) -> [Execute Body] -> [Condition?] -> (No) -> [End]

3. Do-While Loop:
    [Start] -> [Execute Body] -> [Condition?] -> (Yes) -> [Execute Body] -> [Condition?] -> (No) -> [End]
